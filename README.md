This is work that I did on a classification problem on a random dataset. This is to show data cleaning and creation/validation of models.
Also, I have attached a detailed write-up of the models and compared the pros and cons for each one. There is a formatting issue with
the data tables, this is not occuring on my local machine. I will look into it and hopefully fix.
